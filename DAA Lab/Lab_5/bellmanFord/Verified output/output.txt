Example 1:-



Enter number of vertices: 6
Enter number of edges: 9
First vertex: 0
Second vertex: 1
Enter weight: 6

First vertex: 0
Second vertex: 2
Enter weight: 4

First vertex: 0
Second vertex: 3
Enter weight: 5

First vertex: 1
Second vertex: 4
Enter weight: -1

First vertex: 2
Second vertex: 1
Enter weight: -2

First vertex: 2
Second vertex: 4
Enter weight: 3

First vertex: 3
Second vertex: 2
Enter weight: -2

First vertex: 3
Second vertex: 5
Enter weight: -1

First vertex: 4
Second vertex: 5
Enter weight: 3

vertex  shortest distance from source(0)
0       0
1       1
2       3
3       5
4       0
5       3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2:- [Containes negative cycle]

Enter number of vertices: 4
Enter number of edges: 5
First vertex: 0
Second vertex: 1
Enter weight: 4

First vertex: 0
Second vertex: 2
Enter weight: 5

First vertex: 2
Second vertex: 1
Enter weight: 7

First vertex: 1
Second vertex: 3
Enter weight: 7

First vertex: 3
Second vertex: 2
Enter weight: -15

Negative cycle detected. Therefore shortest distance cannot be found.
